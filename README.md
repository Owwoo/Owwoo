- 👋 Hi, I’m @Owwoo
- 👀 I’m interested in competitive sports, gaming (both video and tabletop), anime, nature, psychology, logic based puzzles/strategy, Chelsea (the soccer/football team), music, podcasts, audiobooks, traveling, and time with friends and family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming (still a beginner starting with: Python, JavaScript, C+, and SQL), AI programs, Data Science, game development (applicable coding programs, UI/UX design, need a pc to learn Unity and UE) how to create a manga (writing, art, worldbuilding, etc.), and French (some French background and hope to learn Italian and Japanese in the future)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything... not sure yet. Always looking to learn with others and interesting creating any type with artistic project with someone. Currently working on creating a manga with a friend just because I find it interesting.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me through loganborsari@yahoo.com
